# SnekGame
A Snake game that is Home Brewed and cursed as well

This requires the `pygame` librarie to function. 
  Install instructions for pygame:

Current features:
  Sound effect when eating an apple
  Game music
  Stats screen button
  Control screen button
  Multiple types of apples
    RED - Increases the length of the Snek that ate it
    BLUE - Increases world borders (Has issue of the screen extending off computer screen)
    YELLOW - Increases game speed
    RaInBOw - Winning apple (1/200 spawn chance, has no effect when eaten...working on fixing that. For now, the Sneks ghost through it)

There is a known error where the screen shifts and gets all weird and off center. I have no idea why it does this and my temporary solution is to close and re-open the game.

A `.exe` and folder of sound files can be downloaded and located at: https://github.com/Woldorf/Executable-Games.git
