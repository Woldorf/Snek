    RaInBOw - Winning apple (1/200 spawn chance, has no effect when eaten...working on fixing that. For now, the Sneks ghost through it)

There is a known error where the screen shifts and gets all weird and off center. I have no idea why it does this and my temporary solution is to close and re-open the game.

A `.exe` and folder of sound files can be downloaded and located at: https://github.com/Woldorf/Executable-Games.git
